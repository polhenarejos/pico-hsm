# Pico HSM
This project aims to transform a Raspberry Pi Pico or ESP32 microcontroller into a Hardware Security Module (HSM). The modified Pico or ESP32 board will be capable of generating and storing private keys, performing AES encryption or decryption, and signing data without exposing the private key. Specifically, the private key remains securely on the board and cannot be retrieved since it is encrypted within the flash memory.

## Capabilities

[^4]: Available by using PicoHSM python tool.

### > ESP32-S3 support
Pico HSM also supports ESP32-S3 boards, which add secure storage, flash encryption and secure boot.

### > Dynamic VID/PID
Supports setting VID & PID on-the-fly. Use `pico-hsm-tool.py` or [Pico Commissioner](https://www.picokeys.com/pico-commissioner/ "Pico Commissioner") for specify VID/PID values and reboot the device.

### > Rescue Pico HSM Tool and Commissioner
Pico HSM Tool implements a new CCID stack to rescue the Pico HSM in case it has wrong VID/PID values and it is not recognized by the OS. It can be accessed through `pico-hsm-tool.py` or [Pico Commissioner](https://www.picokeys.com/pico-commissioner/ "Pico Commissioner").

## Security considerations
All secret keys (both asymmetric and symmetric) are encrypted and stored in the flash memory. The MKEK, a 256-bit AES key, is used to protect these private and secret keys. Keys are held in RAM only during signature and decryption operations, and are loaded and cleared each time to avoid potential security vulnerabilities.

The MKEK itself is encrypted using a doubly salted and hashed PIN, and the PIN is hashed in memory during sessions. This ensures that the PIN is never stored in plaintext, neither in flash memory nor in RAM. However, if no secure channel is used, the PIN may be transmitted in plaintext from the host to the HSM.

DKEKs are used during the export and import of private/secret keys and are part of a Key Domain. A Key Domain is a set of secret/private keys that share the same DKEK. These are also shared by the custodians and are not specific to Pico HSM. Therefore, if a key does not belong to a Key Domain (and thus lacks a DKEK), it cannot be exported.

In the event that the Pico is stolen, the private and secret key contents cannot be accessed without the PIN, even if the flash memory is dumped.

### RP2350 and ESP32-S3
RP2350 and ESP32-S3 microcontrollers are equipped with advanced security features, including Secure Boot and Secure Lock, ensuring that firmware integrity and authenticity are tightly controlled. Both devices support the storage of the Master Key Encryption Key (MKEK) in an OTP (One-Time Programmable) memory region, making it permanently inaccessible for external access or tampering. This secure, non-volatile region guarantees that critical security keys are embedded into the hardware, preventing unauthorized access and supporting robust defenses against code injection or firmware modification. Together, Secure Boot and Secure Lock enforce firmware authentication, while the MKEK in OTP memory solidifies the foundation for secure operations.

### Secure Boot
Secure Boot is a security feature that ensures that only trusted firmware, verified through digital signatures, can be loaded onto the device during the boot process. Once enabled, Secure Boot checks every piece of firmware against a cryptographic signature before execution, rejecting any unauthorized or modified code. This prevents malicious firmware from compromising the device’s operation and integrity. With Secure Boot activated, only firmware versions signed by a trusted authority, such as the device manufacturer, will be accepted, ensuring the device remains protected from unauthorized software modifications. **This is irreversible. Once enabled, it CANNOT be disabled.**

**IMPORTANT:** For users wishing to develop and compile custom firmware, a private-public key pair is essential. Activating Secure Boot requires users to generate and manage their own unique private-public key pair. The public key from this pair must be embedded into the device to validate all firmware. Firmware will not boot without a proper digital signature from this key pair. This means that users must sign all future firmware versions with their private key and embed the public key in the device to ensure compatibility.

### Secure Lock
Secure Lock builds on Secure Boot by imposing an even stricter security model. Once activated, Secure Lock prevents any further installation of new boot keys, effectively locking the device to only run firmware that is authorized by the device's primary vendor—in this case, Pico Keys. In addition to preventing additional keys, Secure Lock disables debugging interfaces and puts additional safeguards in place to resist tampering and intrusion attempts. This ensures that the device operates exclusively with the original vendor’s firmware and resists unauthorized access, making it highly secure against external threats. **This is irreversible. Once enabled, it CANNOT be disabled.**

**IMPORTANT:** Activating Secure Lock not only enables Secure Boot but also invalidates all keys except the official Pico Key. This means that only firmware signed by Pico Key will be recognized, and custom code will no longer be allowed. Once enabled, the Pico Key device will run solely on the official firmware available on the website, with no option for generating or compiling new code for the device.

## Download
**If you own an ESP32-S3 board, go to [ESP32 Flasher](https://www.picokeys.com/esp32-flasher/) for flashing your Pico HSM.**

If you own a Raspberry Pico (RP2040 or RP2350), go to [Download page](https://www.picokeys.com/getting-started/), select your vendor and model and download the proper firmware; or go to [Release page](https://www.github.com/polhenarejos/pico-hsm/releases/) and download the UF2 file for your board.

Note that UF2 files are shiped with a dummy VID/PID to avoid license issues (FEFF:FCFD). If you plan to use it with OpenSC or similar tools, you should modify Info.plist of CCID driver to add these VID/PID or use the [Pico Commissioner](https://www.picokeys.com/pico-commissioner/ "Pico Commissioner").

You can use whatever VID/PID (i.e., 234b:0000 from FISJ), but remember that you are not authorized to distribute the binary with a VID/PID that you do not own.

Note that the pure-browser option [Pico Commissioner](https://www.picokeys.com/pico-commissioner/ "Pico Commissioner") is the most recommended.

## Build for Raspberry Pico
Before building, ensure you have installed the toolchain for the Pico and the Pico SDK is properly located in your drive.

```
git clone https://github.com/polhenarejos/pico-hsm
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd pico-hsm
mkdir build
cd build
PICO_SDK_PATH=/path/to/pico-sdk cmake .. -DPICO_BOARD=board_type -DUSB_VID=0x1234 -DUSB_PID=0x5678
make
```
Note that `PICO_BOARD`, `USB_VID` and `USB_PID` are optional. If not provided, `pico` board and VID/PID `FEFF:FCFD` will be used.

Additionally, you can pass the `VIDPID=value` parameter to build the firmware with a known VID/PID. The supported values are:

- `NitroHSM`
- `NitroFIDO2`
- `NitroStart`
- `NitroPro`
- `Nitro3`
- `Yubikey5`
- `YubikeyNeo`
- `YubiHSM`
- `Gnuk`
- `GnuPG`

After running `make`, the binary file `pico_hsm.uf2` will be generated. To load this onto your Pico board:

1. Put the Pico board into loading mode by holding the `BOOTSEL` button while plugging it in.
2. Copy the `pico_hsm.uf2` file to the new USB mass storage device that appears.
3. Once the file is copied, the Pico mass storage device will automatically disconnect, and the Pico board will reset with the new firmware.
4. A blinking LED will indicate that the device is ready to work.

### Docker
Independent from your Linux distribution or when using another OS that supports Docker, you could build a specific pico-hsm version in a Linux container.

```
sudo docker build \
    --build-arg VERSION_PICO_SDK=2.0.0 \
    --build-arg VERSION_MAJOR=5 \
    --build-arg VERSION_MINOR=0 \
    --build-arg PICO_BOARD=waveshare_rp2040_zero \
    --build-arg USB_VID=0xfeff \
    --build-arg USB_PID=0xfcfd \
    -t pico-hsm-builder .

sudo docker run \
    --name mybuild \
    -it pico-hsm-builder \
    ls -l /home/builduser/pico-hsm/build_release/pico_hsm.uf2

sudo docker cp mybuild:/home/builduser/pico-hsm/build_release/pico_hsm.uf2 .

sudo docker rm mybuild
```

## Usage
The firmware uploaded to the Pico contains a reader and a virtual smart card, similar to having a physical reader with an inserted SIM card. We recommend using [OpenSC](http://github.com/opensc/opensc/ "OpenSC") to communicate with the reader. If OpenSC is not installed, you can download and build it or install the binaries for your system.

To ensure that the Pico is detected as an HSM, use the following command:
```sh
opensc-tool -an
```
It should return a text similar to:
```sh
Using reader with a card: Free Software Initiative of Japan Gnuk
3b:fe:18:00:00:81:31:fe:45:80:31:81:54:48:53:4d:31:73:80:21:40:81:07:fa
SmartCard-HSM
```
The name of the reader may vary if you modified the VID/PID.

## Operation time
### Keypair generation
Generating EC keys is almost instant. RSA keypair generation takes some time, specially for `3072` and `4096` bits.

| RSA key length (bits) | Average time (seconds) |
| :---: | :---: |
| 1024 | 16 |
| 2048 | 124 |
| 3072 | 600 |
| 4096 | ~1000 |

### Signature and decrypt
| RSA key length (bits) | Average time (seconds) |
| :---: | :---: |
| 1024 | 1 |
| 2048 | 3 |
| 3072 | 7 |
| 4096 | 15 |

## Press-to-confirm button
The Raspberry Pico includes a BOOTSEL button used for loading firmware initially. Once the Pico HSM firmware is running, this button can be repurposed for additional functionalities. Specifically, the Pico HSM utilizes this button to confirm private and secret operations, a feature that is optional but highly recommended for enhanced security.

When enabled, each time a private or secret key operation is initiated, the Pico HSM enters a waiting state where it awaits user confirmation by pressing the BOOTSEL button. During this waiting period, the Pico HSM's LED remains mostly illuminated but blinks off briefly every second, signaling to the user to press the button for confirmation. If no action is taken, the Pico HSM will continue to wait indefinitely. This operation mode includes periodic timeout commands sent to the host to prevent the session from timing out prematurely.

This feature adds an additional layer of security by requiring physical user intervention for sensitive operations such as signing or decrypting data. It mitigates risks associated with unauthorized applications or scripts using the Pico HSM without user awareness. However, it is not recommended for server environments or other automated settings where physical access to press the button may not be practical.

For more details on configuring and using this feature, refer to the [doc/extra_command.md](/doc/extra_command.md) document.

## Led blink
Pico HSM uses the led to indicate the current status. Four states are available:

### Press to confirm
The Led is almost on all the time. It goes off for 100 miliseconds every second.

![Press to confirm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55573252/162008917-6a730eac-396c-44cc-890e-802294be30a3.gif)

### Idle mode
In idle mode, the Pico HSM goes to sleep. It waits for a command and it is awaken by the driver. The Led is almost off all the time. It goes on for 500 milliseconds every second.

![Idle mode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55573252/162008980-d5a5caad-072e-400c-98e3-2c606b4b2af9.gif)

### Active mode
In active mode, the Pico HSM is awaken and ready to receive a command. It blinks four times in a second.

![Active](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55573252/162008997-1ea8cd7e-5384-4893-9dcb-b473153fc375.gif)

### Processing
While processing, the Pico HSM is busy and cannot receive additional commands until the current is processed. In this state, the Led blinks 20 times in a second.

![Processing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55573252/162009007-df45111e-2473-4a92-97c5-15c3cd19babd.gif)

## Driver

The Pico HSM uses either the `sc-hsm` driver from [OpenSC](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/) or the `sc-hsm-embedded` driver from [CardContact](https://github.com/CardContact/sc-hsm-embedded/) to interface with external applications. These drivers employ the standardized PKCS#11 interface, making it compatible with various cryptographic engines that support PKCS#11, such as OpenSSL, P11 library, or pkcs11-tool.

Internally, the Pico HSM organizes and manages its data using the PKCS#15 structure, which includes elements like PINs, private keys, and certificates. Commands can be issued to interact with these stored elements using tools such as `pkcs15-tool`. For example, `pkcs15-tool -D` lists all elements stored within the Pico HSM.

Communication with the Pico HSM follows the same protocols and methods used with other smart cards, such as OpenPGP cards or similar devices.

For advanced usage scenarios, refer to the documentation and examples provided. Additionally, the Pico HSM supports the SCS3 tool for more sophisticated operations and includes features like multiple key domains. For detailed information on SCS3 usage, refer to [SCS3 documentation](/doc/scs3.md).

### Important
OpenSC relies on PCSC driver, which reads a list (`Info.plist`) that contains a pair of VID/PID of supported readers. In order to be detectable, you have several options:
- Use `pico-hsm-tool.py` to modify VID/PID on-the-fly.
- Use the pure-browser online [Pico Commissioner](https://www.picokeys.com/pico-commissioner/ "Pico Commissioner") that commissions the Pico Key on-the-fly without external tools.
- Build and configure the project with the proper VID/PID with `USB_VID` and `USB_PID` parameters in `CMake` (see [Build section](#build "Build section")). Note that you cannot distribute the patched/compiled binary if you do not own the VID/PID or have an explicit authorization.
